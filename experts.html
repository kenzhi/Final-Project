 <h3>Birds</h3>
<h4>Before You Bring Your Dog Home</h4>
<p>Determine where your dog will be spending most of his time. Because he will be under a lot of stress with the change of environment (from shelter or foster home to your house), he may forget any housebreaking (if any) he’s learned. Often a kitchen will work best for easy clean-up.</p>
<p>If you plan on crate training your dog, be sure to have a crate set-up and ready to go for when you bring your new dog home. Find out more about crate training your dog.</p>
<p>Dog-proof the area where your pooch will spend most of his time during the first few months. This may mean taping loose electrical cords to baseboards; storing household chemicals on high shelves; removing plants, rugs, and breakables; setting up the crate, and installing baby gates.</p>
<p>Training your dog will start the first moment you have him. Take time to create a vocabulary list everyone will use when giving your dog directions. This will help prevent confusion and help your dog learn his commands more quickly. Not sure which commands to use? Check out How to Talk to Your Dog.</p>
<p>Bring an ID tag with your phone number on it with you when you pick up your dog so that he has an extra measure of safety for the ride home and the first few uneasy days. If he is microchipped, be sure to register your contact information with the chip’s company, if the rescue or shelter did not already do so.</p>
<h4>First Day</h4>
<p>We know moving is stressful — and your new dog feels the same way! Give him time to acclimate to your home and family before introducing him to strangers. Make sure children know how to approach the dog without overwhelming him. Go here for more on introducing dogs and children.</p>
<p>When you pick up your dog, remember to ask what and when he was fed. Replicate that schedule for at least the first few days to avoid gastric distress. If you wish to switch to a different brand, do so over a period of about a week by adding one part new food to three parts of the old for several days; then switch to half new food, half old, and then one part old to three parts new. For more information about your dog’s diet, check out our section on Dog Nutrition.
On the way home, your dog should be safely secured, preferably in a crate. Some dogs find car trips stressful, so having him in a safe place will make the trip home easier on him and you.</p>
<p>Once home, take him to his toileting area immediately and spend a good amount of time with him so he will get used to the area and relieve himself. Even if your dog does relieve himself during this time, be prepared for accidents. Coming into a new home with new people, new smells and new sounds can throw even the most housebroken dog off-track, so be ready just in case. Need more housetraining tips? Check out our Dog Housetraining section.</p>
<p>If you plan on crate training your dog, leave the crate open so that he can go in whenever he feels like it in case he gets overwhelmed. Also, be sure to check out the do’s and don’ts of crate training your dog.</p>
<p>From there, start your schedule of feeding, toileting and play/exercise. From Day One, your dog will need family time and brief periods of solitary confinement. Don’t give in and comfort him if he whines when left alone. Instead, give him attention for good behavior, such as chewing on a toy or resting quietly (Source: Preparing Your Home For A New Dog).
For the first few days, remain calm and quiet around your dog, limiting too much excitement (such as the dog park or neighborhood children). Not only will this allow your dog to settle in easier, it will give you more one-on-one time to get to know him and his likes/dislikes.</p>
<p>If he came from another home, objects like leashes, hands, rolled up newspapers and magazines, feet, chairs and sticks are just some of the pieces of “training equipment” that may have been used on this dog. Words like “come here” and “lie down” may bring forth a reaction other than the one you expect.Or maybe he led a sheltered life and was never socialized to children or sidewalk activity. This dog may be the product of a never-ending series of scrambled communications and unreal expectations that will require patience on your part.</p>
<h4>Following Weeks</h4>
<p>People often say they don’t see their dog’s true personality until several weeks after adoption. Your dog may be a bit uneasy at first as he gets to know you. Be patient and understanding while also keeping to the schedule you intend to maintain for feeding, walks, etc. This schedule will show your dog what is expected of him as well as what he can expect from you.</p>
<p>After discussing it with your veterinarian to ensure your dog has all the necessary vaccines, you may wish to take your dog to group training classes or the dog park. Pay close attention to your dog’s body language to be sure he’s having a good time — and is not fearful or a dog park bully. If you’re unsure of what signs to watch for, check out this video on safety at the dog park.</p>
<p>To have a long and happy life together with your dog, stick to the original schedule you created, ensuring your dog always has the food, potty time and attention he needs. You’ll be bonded in no time! For more information on creating a feeding schedule for your dog visit How Often Should You Feed Your Dog?
If you encounter behavior issues you are unfamiliar with, ask your veterinarian for a trainer recommendation. Select a trainer who uses positive-reinforcement techniques to help you and your dog overcome these behavior obstacles. Visit Dog Training for more information on reward-based training.</p>
<p>Congratulations! If you follow these tips, you’ll be on your way to having a well-adjusted canine family member.</p>

    <h3>Cats</h3>
    <p>“Malachy,” a beautiful, three-year-old neutered Persian cat, was brought in to see me soon after our new Center for Behavioral Therapy opened. Quite a confident kitty, Malachy made himself comfortable on our consultation room couch shortly after Tish, his owner, let him out of the carrier. Tish had adopted Malachy “by happenstance” when she was at her groomer’s shop with her cat Cormick. The groomer had acquired Malachy from his previous owner, who could not keep him because he was fighting with the owner’s other cat.</p>

<h4>Litter Box Training</h4>
<p>Fortunately, Malachy and Cormick did not fight. In fact, the two cats became fast friends who loved to play with and chase each other. In his new household, however, Malachy’s toilet habits were far from perfect. Tish had her veterinarian check for medical problems that might explain Malachy’s frequent “mistakes,” but none were found.</p>

<p>Tish had put up with Malachy’s housesoiling for a year before she came in to see me. Recently, the problem had become so bad that Malachy was either urinating or defecating outside the litterbox once a day, and Tish decided she needed help.</p>

<p>Tish and her cats divided their time between an apartment in the city and a country home. Over the year, Tish had provided a variety of litterboxes: some with hoods, some without, some in bathrooms, others in bedrooms. At first Tish used plain clay litter, but most recently she had begun to use a clumpable form. Tish scooped the boxes several times a day and changed the boxes completely once a month, so the cleanliness of the boxes was not in question. Malachy used the boxes, but he also used Tish’s furniture as a toilet. Her chairs and guestroom bed were his favorites.</p>

<h4>The Grass Is Always Greener?</h4>
<p>After learning Malachy’s history, I felt the cat was just not happy with the present state of his litterboxes and was looking for alternatives. Like many Persians, he spent more time pawing the sides of the litterbox than scratching in the litter. (Longhaired cats in general have a higher incidence of litterbox problems. It may be that they don’t want to soil their long, flowing coats!)</p>

<p>With Tish’s help, I set up an experiment to find litterboxes that Malachy would prefer to his owner’s furniture. I asked Tish to provide three large, unhooded litterboxes in both the city and the country. I asked her to continue to use the clumpable litter in one, a section of newspaper in the second and old-fashioned coarse clay litter in the third. Tish was to praise Malachy and give him a treat every time she saw him use a box. Simultaneously, to break the furniture habit, I asked Tish to cover the chairs and bed with pieces of thick vinyl carpet runner, prickly side up.</p>

<p>After the first few weeks it became apparent that Malachy preferred the plain clay litter to the clumpable kind (most cats choose the clumpable litter). The newspaper he didn’t use at all. Cormick was not picky and reliably used any litter that was available. Then we gave Malachy three boxes of his chosen litter in each home. We did this because some cats prefer to urinate and defecate in different places; the third box would make sure there was no overcrowding at the boxes.</p>

<p>For three months there have been no accidents. Tish is ready to remove the protective covers from her chairs and bed. Now that Malachy is in the habit of using the new boxes, he shouldn’t go back to his old habits.
</p>
<h4>Excellent Prognosis</h4>
<p>Urination and defecation outside the litterbox is the most common feline behavior problem. Many cats are given up because of house-soiling problems. Most of the time this is unnecessary. The prognosis for cats with problems like Malachy’s is excellent. Between 70 percent and 75 percent of litterbox problems are cured by simple treatments like the one Tish employed with Malachy. If your cat begins to urinate or defecate outside the box, see your veterinarian first. He or she will rule out medical causes. If the problem is considered to be a behavioral one, ask for a referral to a cat behavior specialist.</p>

    <h3>Fish</h3>
     <p>People keep many species as companion animals, each having its own dietary needs. Here at The ASPCA’s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital, I treat the “frequent flyers,” so to speak. The most frequently seen are in the psittacine family, which includes macaws, parrots, conures, cockatiels and budgies. For this reason, I will focus on providing a balanced diet for this group of birds.</p>
    <p>While they can be a nutritious and important food in a bird’s diet, no single seed or seed mix can supply a bird with all of his dietary requirements. Birds in the wild will eat seeds exclusively only when other foods are unavailable, as a sort of survival diet. When food supplies are abundant, birds will eat a wide array of food items to correct any imbalance in their diets, including insects, worms, fruits, vegetables and grains.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, many birds have been raised on, or are “addicted to,” all-seed diets. All efforts to convert such picky eaters to a healthy diet such as bird pellets become extremely difficult, because birds usually are resistant to change. This resistance may be explained in part by an instinctive, protective mechanism that serves to prevent birds living in the wild from eating poisonous substances. And, birds initially may not recognize new foods as edible substances. In many cases, an animal may choose a small variety of foods or one single seed such as sunflower and refuse to eat anything else. Such an imbalance is an invitation to disease. Sunflower seeds alone, for example, are extremely deficient in nutrients and very high in fat.</p>
    
    <p>Wild birds naturally alter their diet seasonally as one food supply becomes scarce and another becomes available. Nature’s gradual change of food substances better allows them to adjust to the new diet. A similar slow technique of adjusting your birds’ diet to pelleted foods can be used at home:</p>
    
    <h4>Step One</h4> 
    <p>To effect a healthy change-over in birds who are “seed junkies,” begin by getting your bird eating a good-quality seed mix if he is not on one now. You can distinguish these from poor mixes in several ways. Healthier seed mixes minimize or eliminate fat-filled sunflower seeds and peanuts. Instead, they include a large list of ingredients such as oats, corn, hemp, rape seed, flax and various types of millet. Often, prime-quality mixes also are vitamin- and mineral-fortified.</p>
    
    <p>If your bird’s seed mix is not enriched, you can add powdered vitamins. But despite what you hear in pet stores and read on vitamin labels, do not add the supplements to your bird’s drinking water. This can alter the taste and color of the water, thus discouraging him from drinking. Instead, sprinkle a small amount of powdered vitamins on the seeds. Add supplements only if your bird’s food is not vitamin- and mineral-fortified.</p>
    
    <h4>Step Two</h4>
    <p>Try layering new foods — avian pellets, dry breakfast cereals such as puffed rice, puffed wheat and puffed millet and even whole grain breads — with layers of the familiar seeds. Be sure the cereals and breads contain protein, vitamins and minerals and are very low in fat and sugar. This technique usually works, although it may take weeks or even months to see a change. Patience is extremely important.</p>
    <h4>Step Three</h4>
    <p>Add layers of the various vitamin- and mineral-enriched bird “nuggets” and “cakes” now on the market. These products, composed of seeds and fully balanced foods, can be crushed and added in layers with the seeds and foods introduced in Step Two.</p>
    
    <p>As these cakes and nuggets already contain the familiar seeds, your birds may accept them if you are lucky, thus eliminating the need to add seed layers in between. However, in most instances, you will be adding cakes and nuggets to seed-only layers, which you can slowly eliminate. Eventually your bird will be eating seeds already contained in the nuggets or cakes alone.</p>
    
    <h4>Step Four</h4>
    
    <p>The final step is to add layers of pelleted food in between the cakes and nuggets, which you will then eliminate over time.</p>
    
    <p>If you are able to convert your birds to the pelleted diet, you have done very well. Don’t despair if you have succeeded only in changing over to cakes or nuggets — already you have improved your bird’s diet considerably. To avoid this tedious process altogether, I recommend that owners start all young birds on pellets as soon as possible after weaning.</p>
    
    <p>In the wild, birds eat mainly in the morning and evening, so you can mimic this natural pattern by feeding your birds two meals a day. And never restrict food in debilitated birds. Considering the wide variety of healthy choices available for your bird’s diets, they no longer must suffer from poor nutrition.</p>

    <p>In the wild, birds eat mainly in the morning and evening, so you can mimic this natural pattern by feeding your birds two meals a day. And never restrict food in debilitated birds. Considering the wide variety of healthy choices available for your bird’s diets, they no longer must suffer from poor nutrition.</p>
